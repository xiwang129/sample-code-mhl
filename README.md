# sample-code-mhl

## Description: 

The goal of this project is to deploy an open-sourced contexual bandits model into AWS using SageMaker, Lambda and API Gateway. This was a team project, so for this repo, I have included some of the scripts that I created.

1. a SageMaker notebook instance 
2. a model serving script
3. a test script for api endpoint 

Note: I also included another project here for data science and visiluzation

4. Netflix content strategy analysis
